# Amplication Documentation

---

Hi, welcome to Amplication's documentation.

[Amplication](/about/) is an openâ€‘source development tool. It helps professional Node.js developers to develop quality Node.js applications without spending time on repetitive coding tasks.

Amplication auto-generates fully functional apps based on TypeScript and Node.js.

## What Amplication helps you generate

Generated apps include NestJS, Prisma, [REST API](/api/#rest-api), [GraphQL API](/api/#graphql-api), a React admin UI, authentication, authorization, and logging.

1. Easily create data models, and role-based access control and let Amplication generate your application.
2. Instantly download the source code of your application or push a new Pull Request to a GitHub repository.
3. Keep developing your application with your coding skills and come back to Amplication at any time to add models and roles and generate new versions.
4. Optionally, download or [build a Docker container](/deploy/) with your database, a Node.js application, and a React client and continuously deploy your application to the cloud or your local environment.
