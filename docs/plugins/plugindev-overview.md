# Plugin Development Overview 

A plugin is a custom TypeScript code that extends Amplication developer platform with new features. The features incorporated can be generic, useful to a wide variety of users, or can be very specific to deal with specialized requirements. 

If you or your organization have a specific workflow, install an existing plugin or write one to customize the platform to perform your required tasks.

All published plugins are available on the All Plugins page on the Amplication interface. All plugins installed on a particular project are available in the Installed Plugins page.
