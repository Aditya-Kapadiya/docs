## Context

In each lifecycle function (before and after), we have access to a global object called **context** which holds common data between event

|  Name |  Type |  Description |
|---|---|---|
| resourceType  | keyOf typeOf EnumResourceType  | the type of the resource: `MessageBroker` `ProjectConfiguration` `Service`  |
| resourceInfo  | AppInfo  |  the general data of the app:name, description, version, id, URL, and settings (resource settings) |
|  entities | Entity[]  | the list of entities in the service  |
|  roles |  roles | the list of roles in the service  |
pluginInstallations | pluginInstallations |a list of the installed plugins
|  topics | Topic[] |a list of topics that are connected to a specific service   |
|  modules |  Module[] |  list of the generated modules (files) |
|  DTOs |  DTOs | list of the generated DTOs  |
|  plugins | PluginMap  | a `Map` of the event name with its before and after function, and event params  |
| logger  |  winston.Logger |   a logger that can be used to log messages inside the plugin|
| utils  | ContextUtil  |  an interface that exposes utility functionalities and properties, such as `skipDefaultBehavior` - will be explained later, and `imporStaticModules` - provides access to the static generated files |
|  clientDirectories |  clientDirectories |  helps to determine where a specific file or folder will be generated in the generated admin-ui folder `baseDirectory``srcDirectory``authDirectory``publicDirectory``apiDirectory` |
|  serverDirectories |   serverDirectories| helps to determine where a specific file or folder will be generated in the generated server folder `baseDirectory` `srcDirectory` `authDirectory`  `scriptsDirectory` `messageBrokerDirectory`  |



## Skip Default Behavior

In the `before` function, you can call the `skipDefaultBehavior` from the context and set it to true (by default its value is false): 

```tsx
context.utils.skipDefaultBehavior = true;
```

As a result, the default functionality wonâ€™t be executed and you will have to provide your own logic. You can do it after the skip in the `before` function, or in the `after` function. 



:::important

Using `skipDefaultBehavior` and not providing an alternative functionality can cause unexpected behavior. For example, if the skipped event generates files that are imported from other files, so use it wisely and carefully.
