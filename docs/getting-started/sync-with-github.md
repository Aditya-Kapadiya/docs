# Sync with GitHub


Amplication can push the code of your app to a GitHub repository. It will provide you with full control over your project and will also allow you to easily track the code generated by Amplication.

Note: Amplication [Free](https://www.notion.so/Docs-Enhanced-GitHub-Sync-1d39a40d39644b06a977821edc5728bf) Plan works differently from the Pro and Enterprise Plans. See below for details. 

## Creating a new repository in GitHub

If you want to create a new repository in GitHub, you can do so [here](https://github.com/new). Select **Initialize this repository with a README file** to make sure the new repository is not empty.

## Working on Local Amplication Server

If you are hosting a local Amplication server, you should first read [Connect Amplication server to GitHub](https://docs.amplication.com/running-amplication-platform/connect-server-to-github/) to see how to configure the Server to work with a new GitHub application.

## Using the Amplication hosted service

If you are using the hosted service on [https://app.amplication.com](https://app.amplication.com/), you can continue with this article.

## Authorize Amplication to access your GitHub account[](https://docs.amplication.com/sync-with-github/#authorize-amplication-to-access-your-github-account)

Before integrating your application with GitHub, you need to authorize Amplication to get access to your GitHub account.

1. Open up an Amplication project.
2. Click **Connect to GitHub** at the bottom left of your project. The sync with GitHub screen opens.

:::note
If this is the first time that you have connected to GitHub, the **Connect to GitHub** button is displayed.
If you have already connected to GitHub, you will be prompted to choose the installed organization. If several organizations are configured, you will be prompted to select the required organization.

3. Click **Connect to GitHub**
   The _Install Amplication Github App_ opens.

4. Select the GitHub account you want to use.
5. In the new window, select on which repositories you want to install the app.

:::note
Currently, only by connecting to an organization can you create a new GitHub Repository. A User can sync only with an existing repository.
