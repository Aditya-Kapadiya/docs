## Build Docker image and run Docker container

You can also easily build a Docker container to prepare your app for deployment. Your app is always generated with all the configuration and scripts needed to do so.

First clone source code from your repository. See [Sync with GitHub](https://docs.amplication.com/docs/sync-with-github/) section for more information about working with source code.

To run your app in Docker with a functional database, execute the docker-compose command:

```
docker-compose up
```
